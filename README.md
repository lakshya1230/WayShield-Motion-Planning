# WayShield-Motion-Planning
Search and Sampling-Based Motion Planning for Protected Autonomous Robots

## Overview
This project implements and compares search-based and sampling-based motion planning algorithms in various 3D environments. The goal is to navigate a robot from a start point to a goal while avoiding obstacles and minimizing path cost using Euclidean distance as the primary metric.

## Technical Approach

### Search-based Planning Algorithm

In the search-based planning approach, I implemented the Weighted A* algorithm. Weighted A* is an exten- sion of the classic A* search algorithm, which combines the principles of uniform-cost search and heuristic- driven search to efficiently find a path from the start node to the goal.

### Sampling-based Planning Algorithm

For the sampling-based planning algorithm, I used RRT algorithm. Algorithm 2 expresses the details of the RRT algorithm.While this assignment primarily focuses on basic mo- tion planning algorithms, it’s worth briefly introducing RRT* and RRT-Connect as extensions of the stan- dard RRT algorithm, which can be explored in greater depth in future work.
The RRT* algorithm incorporates a cost function based on path length to more effectively guide the tree’s expansion. Additionally, it introduces a rewiring mechanism that enables the algorithm to refine paths over time, increasing the likelihood of finding more op- timal solutions. Similarly, RRT-Connect enhances RRT by growing two trees simultaneously—one from the start and one from the goal—aiming to connect them quickly, which improves performance in complex environments.

### Collision-checking Algorithm

Once a path is generated by the planning algorithm, the robot can use it to navigate toward the goal. However, it is possible that some segments of the path in- tersect with obstacles in the environment, leading to potential collisions. To ensure the feasibility of the path, collision-checking algorithms are integrated into the planning process to detect whether any part of the trajectory intersects with obstacle boundaries. These checks are essential for validating candidate paths and are used repeatedly during planning. The implementa- tion details are presented in Algorithm 3.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the fundamental trade-offs between search-based and sampling-based motion planning approaches. Weighted A* provides optimal solutions at higher computational cost, while RRT offers faster, probabilistically complete solutions with less optimal paths. The choice between algorithms depends on specific application requirements for optimality, computation time, and environment complexity.
